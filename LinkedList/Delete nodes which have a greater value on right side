//brute force
Use two loops. In the outer loop, pick nodes of the linked list one by one. In the inner loop, check if there exist a node whose value is greater than the picked node. If there exists a node whose value is greater, then delete the picked node. 
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
//OPTIMAL METHOD:
Node *compute(Node *head)
{
      Node* temp = head;
        while(temp != NULL && temp->next != NULL){
             
            //Copying next node data into current node
              //i.e. we are indirectly deleting current node
            if(temp->data < temp->next->data){
                temp->data = temp->next->data;
                temp->next = temp->next->next;
            }
            else{
                  //move to the next node
                temp = temp->next;
            }
        }
      return head;
}
