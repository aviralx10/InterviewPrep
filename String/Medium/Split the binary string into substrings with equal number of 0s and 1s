Initialize count = 0 and traverse the string character by character and keep track of the number of 0s and 1s so far
, whenever the count of 0s and 1s become equal increment the count. If the count of 0s and 1s in the original string 
is not equal then print -1 else print the value of count after the traversal of the complete string.

int maxSubStr(string str, int n) 
{ 
  
    // To store the count of 0s and 1s 
    int count0 = 0, count1 = 0; 
  
    // To store the count of maximum 
    // substrings str can be divided into 
    int cnt = 0; 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
        if (str[i] == '0') { 
            count0++; 
        } 
        else { 
            count1++; 
        } 
        if (count0 == count1) { 
            cnt++; 
        } 
    } 
  
    // It is not possible to 
    // split the string 
    if (count0 != count1) { 
        return -1; 
    } 
  
    return cnt; 
}
